Army Soul
let me say you somthing about an indian army personell:
Manoj Kumar Pandey, PVC (25 June 1975 â€“ 3 July 1999) was an officer of the Indian Army who was posthumously awarded India's highest military honour, the Param Vir Chakra, for his audacious courage and leadership during the Kargil War in 1999. An officer of the 1st battalion, 11 Gorkha Rifles (1/11 GR), he was Killed in action during the attack on Jubar Top of the Khalubar Hills in Batalik Sector of Kargil.
the most important thing about him is that he fought for the India in the kargil war:
In early May, the intrusion in the Kargil sector was reported.[6] The 1/11 Gorkha Rifles battalion had finished a one-and-a-half year tenure in the Siachen Glacier and was on-the-move to its peace-time location in Pune. The battalion was asked to move to the Batalik sector in Kargil. It was among the first units to be inducted into this sector. The unit, commanded by Colonel Lalit Rai, was assigned responsibility of the Jubar, Kukarthaam and Khalubar areas and their battalion headquarters was in Yeldor.

Pandey, as part of the battalion, was involved in a series of boldly led attacks. He also took part in a series of actions which led to the capture of Jubar Top.
He was head shotted but still even after that shot his courage and patriotism made hime kill his rivals.
so Hatts off for also.
actually indian army have a lot of these braves.
